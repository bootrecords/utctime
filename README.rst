UTC Time v0.1.0-dev
-------------------

A tiny library to simplify the everyday pain of working with UTC and ISO 8601 date times in Python.

Goals:

1. Easily create UTC datetimes without thinking about it.
2. Type-safe. Don't accidentally mix and match UTC with non-UTC datetimes.
3. Convert to and from ISO 8601 datetimes with ease (and use Z as the timezone instead of +00:00).
4. Don't accidentally convert to anything else.
5. No dependencies. We don't need to pull in pytz just for UTC.
6. Interoperate with regular datetime objects where necessary.
